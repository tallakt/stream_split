# StreamSplit

Split a stream into a head and tail, or peek at the first `n` items in a
stream. Both without iterating the tail of the enumerable.

iex> head
[1, 2, 3, 1]
iex> Enum.take(tail, 7)
[2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1, 2]
```

```elixir
iex> {head, new_enum} = StreamSplit.peek(Stream.cycle(1..3), 4)
iex> head
[1, 2, 3, 1]
iex> Enum.take(new_enum, 7)
[1, 2, 3, 1, 2, 3, 1]
